## Sai-Manaswini-M---Data-Analyst-portfolio
Hi, I'm Sai Manaswini M, I have an analytical background in Computer Science and currently, I am Pursuing  my Masters in Business Analysis  . I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

##Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
#####Working with a real world data-set using SQL and Python
**Code:** [](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
