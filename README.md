## Sai-Manaswini-M---Data-Analyst-portfolio
Hi, I'm Sai Manaswini M, I have an analytical background in Computer Science and currently, I am Pursuing  my Masters in Business Analysis  . I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
